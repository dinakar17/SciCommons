 The project aims to create a social-web tool for rating and commenting on research reports (Stackoverflow for scientific articles). It's important because it can improve the quality of research by providing a platform for detailed comments, ratings, and reputation-based filtering. It also allows communities of reviewers to form and manage the reviewing process.
